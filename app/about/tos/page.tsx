                    <p>
                        Exclusion of Liability. In no event will we (including our affiliates,
                        agents, directors, employees, suppliers, or licensors) be liable for any
                        indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary
                        damages you might experience from our services, including damages for

                        Basis of the Bargain. The limitations of damages set forth above are
                        fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between you and
                        Genfluence. This limitation of liability section applies whether the
                        alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict
                        liability, or any other basis, even if we have been advised of the
                        possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability will

                    <p>
                        Please read the following arbitration agreement (“Arbitration
                        Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes between you
                        and Genfluence, which means you will only be able to pursue claims and
                        seek relief against us on an individual basis through arbitration. You
                        are also waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have
                        a jury trial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute,
                        claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use
                        of our Services, to any products sold or distributed through our
                        Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with us, will be
                        resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (a)
                        you may bring claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and
                        (b) you and Genfluence can seek equitable relief in court for
                        infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as
                        trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration
                        Agreement applies, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and
                        requests for relief that originated or were claimed before the effective
                        date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.

                    <p>
                        Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to the
                        interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin
                        an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration
                        and describing your claim to our registered agent at National Registered
                        Agents, Inc., 160 Greentree Drive, Suite 101, Dover, DE 19904. The
                        arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative
                        dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims,
                        or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees
                        and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the

                        </a>
                        . All other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of

                    <p>
                        If JAMS is unable to handle the matter, you and Genfluence will work
                        together to select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator
                        finds that you cannot afford to pay their filing, administrative,
                        hearing and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver, we will pay
                        them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS’ filing,
                        administrative, hearing and/or other fees totaling less than $10,000,
                        unless the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous. You may
                        choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
                        submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another
                        mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
                        arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority
                        to: (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
                        Agreement; and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
                        applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration
                        Agreement. The arbitration will decide each of your and Genfluence’s
                        rights and liabilities, if any. The arbitration proceeding will not be
                        consolidated or joined with any other matters or parties. The arbitrator
                        will have the authority to grant motions resolving any claim, to award
                        monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
                        available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this
                        Agreement. The arbitrator will issue a written award and decision
                        describing the essential findings and conclusions underlying any award,
                        including the calculation of any damages. The award of the arbitrator is
                        final and binding upon both you and Genfluence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Waiver of Jury Trial. You and Genfluence both waive any constitutional
                        and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a
                        judge or a jury. You and Genfluence instead choose that all disputes,
                        claims, or requests for relief will be resolved by arbitration, except
                        as specified above. An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief
                        as a court and must follow our Agreement as a court would.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. All disputes,
                        claims, and requests for relief within the scope of this Arbitration
                        Agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class
                        or collective basis. Only individual relief is available. Claims of more
                        than one Member cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of
                        another Member. If the arbitrator issues a decision that enforcement of
                        these provisions is not applicable to a specific dispute, claim or
                        request for relief, then only those specific issues will be removed and
                        brought into the state or federal courts of the State of Florida.
