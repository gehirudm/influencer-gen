# API reference | API Docs

Luxfin provides a powerful and secure REST API that allows merchants to interact with the Luxfin platform. With this API, you can initiate payments, query transactions, and receive real-time updates via webhooks.

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a standard architecture that uses HTTP methods to perform operations on resources via predictable URLs.

Luxfin's API follows REST principles and uses JSON format for requests and responses.

All API requests should be sent to the base URL using HTTPS.

All API requests must be authenticated using a **Bearer Token** in the request header.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
